# Splunk - Boss of the SOC v1

My progress through the version 1 challenge.

I just want to give credit to those at Splunk involved in making the Boss of the SOC - version 1. I do not want to spoil anything for those who have not completed the lab, but it made me enjoy this one because of the storyline. Click the link to each scenario to follow along with me as I work through the case.
